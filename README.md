# Team Page!! Go Team!
## This is the team page challenge from [DevChallenges.io](https://devchallenges.io/)

### Meet the [team](https://didibonocore.github.io/team-page-devchallenges/)
It's a simple and ellegant static page built in HTML and CSS. I chose to do the entire page using pure CSS (no framework) to keep it challenging and learn more.
Feel free to to make suggestions or use this code for your own work.

Thanks for checking out my work,
Eugenia
